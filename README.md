# 3D Reconstruction and Camera Calibration: A Computer Vision Project

## Overview

In this in-depth project at Carnegie Mellon University, I ventured into the realms of 3D reconstruction and camera calibration, essential components in the expansive field of computer vision. The journey stretched from understanding triangulation and epipolar geometry to implementing cutting-edge algorithms for reconstructing 3D scene structures from image pairs.

This project was an integral part of my computer vision course at Carnegie Mellon University. All related content and code are credited to Carnegie Mellon University.

## Learning Objectives

- Develop a robust grasp of the principles of triangulation and epipolar geometry.
- Gain practical skills in reconstructing 3D scene structures from a pair of images.

## Assignment Breakdown

### Part 1: 3D Reconstruction 

- **Eight Point Algorithm**
  - Delved into the Eight-Point Algorithm to grasp its essence and its role in estimating the fundamental matrix, a representation of the epipolar geometry between two images.

- **Essential Matrix**
  - Gained insights into the Essential Matrix, its relationship with the fundamental matrix, and its crucial role in describing geometric information between two calibrated camera views.

- **Epipolar Correspondence**
  - Engaged with the concept of epipolar correspondence, learning how corresponding points in stereo images relate and the importance of this relationship in stereo vision.

- **Triangulation**
  - Implemented triangulation techniques to determine the 3D coordinates of points in space, given their projections on two distinct images.

### Part 2: Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction

- **Checkerboard Pattern Detection and Camera Calibration**
  - Dived into camera calibration techniques using checkerboard patterns, understanding the significance of these patterns and the role they play in estimating intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters.

- **Feature Descriptor Matching and Fundamental Matrix Estimation**
  - Developed an appreciation for feature descriptor matching, understanding its importance in computer vision tasks, and its role in estimating the fundamental matrix.

## Insights & Takeaways

- Attained a comprehensive understanding of 3D reconstruction techniques and the intricacies of camera calibration.
- Gained valuable hands-on experience in implementing cutting-edge computer vision algorithms, further enhancing my problem-solving capabilities in the realm of image processing.
